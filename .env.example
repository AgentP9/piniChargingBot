# MQTT Topic Configuration
# You can now define devices with custom names and MQTT topics
# New format: "Device Name:mqtt/topic,Another Device:another/topic"
# Examples:
#   MQTT_DEVICES=Office Charger:shellies/shellyplug07,Kitchen Charger:shellies/shellyplug02
#   MQTT_DEVICES=Living Room:home/plugs/living-room,Garage:home/plugs/garage
# 
# Legacy format (backward compatible): "deviceId,deviceId2"
# Example: MQTT_DEVICES=shellyplug-s-12345,shellyplug-s-67890
#
# Each device will subscribe to: {topic}/relay/0 and {topic}/relay/0/power
MQTT_DEVICES=Office Charger:shellies/shellyplug07,Kitchen Charger:shellies/shellyplug02
